`docker run node`

```
Go to your required directory and run below command
`docker run node`

The above command will download `node` image from the docker hub

```

`docker run -it node`

```
The below command means, (by adding `-it`) to expose to us and we can enter/interact into the container and perform node operations. But this does not mean node is running in our local machine.
`docker run -it node`

The above command will download `node` image from the docker hub

```
